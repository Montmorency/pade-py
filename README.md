Pade-py
=======

Python library for calculating Pade approximants based on Chebyshev Polynomials. Based on the algorithms described in Ref.:

[Fast and Stable Interpolation In Roots of Unity and Chebyshev Points Ricardo Pachon, Pedro Gonnet, And Joris Van Deun, SIAM J. NUMER. ANAL. Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 1713-1734](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/100797291)

and the recursive pade approximation algorithm described in:

[Vidberg, H. J. and Serene, J. W. Solving the Eliashberg equations by means of N-point Pad√© approximants, Journal of Low Temperature Physics  Vol. 29, pp. 179-192](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00655090)

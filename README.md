Pade-py
=======

Python library for calculating Pade approximants based on Chebyshev Polynomials. Based on the algorithms described in Ref.:

Fast and Stable Interpolation In Roots of Unity and Chebyshev Points Ricardo Pachon, Pedro Gonnet, And Joris Van Deun
SIAM J. NUMER. ANAL. Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 1713-1734

and the recursive pade approximation algorithm described in:

Vidberg, H. J. and Serene, J. W. Solving the Eliashberg equations by means of N-point Pad√© approximants
Journal of Low Temperature Physics  Vol. 29, pp. 179-192

to run

  python cheb_pade.py

or

  python pade.py

to see example approximations to a trial function.
